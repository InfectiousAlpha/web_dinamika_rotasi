Dinamika Rotasi - Virtual Lab ⚛️A high-performance, interactive web simulation for learning Rotational Dynamics (Dinamika Rotasi). This project helps students visualize concepts like Torque, Moment of Inertia, and Angular Acceleration using HTML5 Canvas.🌟 FeaturesReal-time Physics Engine: Calculates angular velocity, acceleration, and torque 60 times per second.3 Distinct Simulation Modes:Single Particle: Basic rotation around a fixed pivot.Rigid Rotor: Two-body system demonstrating coupled translation and rotation.Multi-Particle System: Dynamic system where users can add/remove particles to observe the additive nature of Inertia ($I = \sum mr^2$).Interactive Controls: Sliders for Mass, Radius, Force, and Damping (Air Resistance).Math Visualization: Integrated LaTeX formulas using MathJax.Modern UI: Responsive Dark Mode design with Glassmorphism effects using Tailwind CSS.🚀 Simulations Explained1. Single Particle RotationFocuses on Newton's Second Law for Rotation.Formula: $\tau = I \cdot \alpha$Interaction: Change the mass or radius to see how "heavy" the rotation feels (Inertia). Apply force to generate Torque.2. Rigid Rotor (2D Motion)Simulates a rigid rod with two masses (like a baton or diatomic molecule).Physics: Handles both Linear Motion ($F=ma$) and Rotational Motion ($\tau=I\alpha$).Interaction: Apply different forces to each end of the rod to create pure rotation, pure translation, or complex chaotic motion.3. Multi-Particle SystemDemonstrates the Principle of Superposition for Moment of Inertia.Feature: Add up to 10 particles on a single axis.Physics: $I_{total} = m_1r_1^2 + m_2r_2^2 + ...$Interaction: Visualizes how distributing mass further from the center increases resistance to rotation.🛠️ Technology StackCore: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)Rendering: HTML5 Canvas API (2D Context)Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN)Math Rendering: MathJaxFonts: Inter & Google Fonts📦 Installation & SetupBecause this project uses JavaScript ES6 Modules (import/export), you cannot simply open index.html in your browser. It requires a local web server to bypass CORS policies.Method 1: VS Code (Recommended)Install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey.Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server".Method 2: PythonIf you have Python installed, run this in your terminal within the project folder:# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.Method 3: Node.jsIf you have Node.js installed:npx serve .
